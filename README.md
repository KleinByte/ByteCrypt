# ByteCrypt
This Project aims to implement folder encryption with support for git hooks to prevent unencrypted files from getting added to git history.
---
### This repo is meant to live as its own directory next to the folder to-be-encrypted.

EX: to be encrypted --> "somepath/Office/notebook"
    this projects home --> "somepath/Office/ByteCrypt"
